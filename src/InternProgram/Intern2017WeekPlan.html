            <li>I had to pair program with one of the interns in regard to the database setup process for the tests.  The Tiny Returns project is not clear on how the database structure relates to the reporting web / excel.  This is something that needs fixing.</li>

            <li>We have decided to pick up the Team City artifact creation and Portfolio User Interface (UI) design to fill in the time.</li>

            <li>The interns needed more of a background in MVC to be fully successful this week.  This is something we must improve on.</li>
            <li>Paul did a demo of an MVC feature using a TDD style of coding.</li>
            <li>We could not get the OOP presentation completed this week.  So we will move early next week.</li>
